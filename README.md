# GalgelegDTU

I created this project as part of my 3. semester during my studies at DTU. The software was developed using code-segments and inspiration from AndroidElements, created by Jacob Nordfalk.
The underlying logic of the project was provided by J. Nordfalk, and I take no credit for supplied logic, only for it's application, and teh UI/UX of the app.
